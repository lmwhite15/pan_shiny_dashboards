# Shiny Dashboards for Precision Aging Network Projects

Top folder contains code to pull and de-identify data from Box Health and then save within the dashboard folders. I need to process the data outside of the folders because app deployment requires all data to be within the folder sent to shinyapps.io. 

All of the dashboards contain custom.css and PAN_logo3.png files to make the apps look nice. The deployApp.R files in each folder publish the apps to shinyapps.io.
